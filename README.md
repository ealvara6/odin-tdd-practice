# odin-tdd-practice

In this project, I display my ability to work with a Test Driven Developmnent approach. I create multiple test first, then write the code that meets the requirements of those tests.

## functions
- `capitalize(string)` function that takes a string and returns it with first character capitalized
- `reverseString(string)` function that takes a string and returns it reversed
- `Calculator` object with `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, and `multiply` functions that recieves two numbers and returns the correct calculation
- `caesarCipher(string, shift)`function that takes a string and shift factor and returns the string with each character "shifted"
    - Read more about how a Caesar cipher works [here](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/)
- `analyzeArray(array)` function that take an array of numbers and returns an object
    - `average` average of the sum of all numbers in the array
    - `min` smallest number in the array
    - `max` highest number in the array
    - `length` length of the array
